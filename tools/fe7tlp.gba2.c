But even she failed.\x03\x01After being exposed to the toxic\x01ether, she became sick as well.\x03\x01More and more victims came\x01about--Lanmark, Holton, and I\x03\x01were all chosen to be\x01Imperial Generals...\x03\x01because like His Majesty,\x01we lost our families to that scum!\x03\x01My sister was all I had left,\x03\x01but because Richard \"the Benedict\"\x01showed that Valencian mercy,\x03\x01we all suffered!\x03\x01If you sickly, cruel-hearted\x01Valencians ceased to exist...\x03\x01If all of you other countries didn't\x01have to bring us down, my sister would--\x03\x01\x0B\x01Your sister wouldn't have died.\x01And neither would my best friend.\x03\x01\x09\x01W-What...?\x03\x01Your brother killed him!\x01I read your mind earlier!\x03\x01\x0B\x01...Yeah, he did.\x03\x01But it was thanks to\x01Magnus's order that he did.\x03\x01\x09\x01What are you talking about?\x01We never...\x03\x01\x0B\x01You still haven't finished\x01telling your story, have you?\x03\x01\x09\x01\x16......\x16\x01Fine...

And they did.\x03\x01Few knew of the transition, and even\x01fewer knew of the real tragedy.\x03\x01\x0D\x01\x16......\x16\x03\x01\x0B\x01...They did more than that.\x03\x01They knew that anyone who lived\x01in those woods might be infected\x03\x01with the disease, and could\x01potentially cause more deaths.\x03\x01Thus they sent the only\x01person on the continent\x03\x01who could silence\x01ether intoxication.\x03\x01Leon Zenair, the Sword Emperor,\x01and thus wielder of \"Imperius\".\x03\x01With a sword that can dissipate ether,\x01he could kill anyone before getting\x03\x01infected by the toxic ether himself.\x03\x01The fire wasn't enough;\x01humans are amazing at surviving.\x03\x01And so Leon... and so the bastard...\x01who shares my same blood...\x03\x01Set the woods--my best friend's\x01and my home--on fire.\x03\x01We ran south as soon as we figured\x01out it was Magnus's doing.\x03",
